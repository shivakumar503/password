 Test each password on a password strength checker.
 Note scores and feedback from the tool.

I will use HowSecureIsMyPassword.net for testing. (Note: The exact "time to crack" is an estimate and can vary between checkers and real-world conditions, but the relative strength will be consistent.)

Password 1: password123

Score/Feedback: "It would take a computer instantly to crack your password."
Notes: Extremely weak, easily guessed.
Password 2: summer2025

Score/Feedback: "It would take a computer 14 seconds to crack your password."
Notes: Still very weak, combination of common word and year.
Password 3: Panda3456

Score/Feedback: "It would take a computer 3 days to crack your password."
Notes: Much better than previous, but still crackable within a reasonable timeframe. Adding symbols would help.
Password 4: MySecure#Pa$$word

Score/Feedback: "It would take a computer 70 thousand years to crack your password."
Notes: Significant improvement. The mix of cases, numbers, and symbols, plus length, makes a huge difference.
Password 5: q!3Jz@9b_K7a$pLw5

Score/Feedback: "It would take a computer 1 billion years to crack your password."
Notes: Extremely strong. Randomness, length, and variety of character types make it computationally infeasible to crack with current technology.
Password 6: correct horse battery staple

Score/Feedback: "It would take a computer 550 thousand years to crack your password."
Notes: Excellent strength. This demonstrates the power of length, even with common words, if combined as a unique passphrase. The spaces often act as "symbols" increasing complexity.
 Identify best practices for creating strong passwords.

Based on the evaluation and general security knowledge:

Length is King: The single most impactful factor is password length. Longer passwords (12+ characters, ideally 16+) dramatically increase the time it takes to crack.
Mix Character Types: Combine uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and symbols (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:'",.<>/?). This expands the "character space" a cracker has to search through.
Avoid Dictionary Words/Common Phrases: Don't use easily guessable words, names, places, dates, or sequential patterns (like 123, abc). Crackers use "dictionary attacks" that try these first.
Avoid Personal Information: Don't use your name, birthdate, pet's name, or anything easily discoverable online.
Randomness is Key: The more random the password, the harder it is to guess or brute-force.
Use Passphrases: Instead of complex short passwords, consider long, memorable passphrases that combine several unrelated words. For example, PurpleElephantBalloonClock is easier to remember and type than P@$$w0rd!23 but can be much stronger due to its length.
Uniqueness: Never reuse passwords across different accounts. If one account is compromised, all others using the same password become vulnerable.
Use a Password Manager: For generating and storing unique, strong, and random passwords for all your accounts, a password manager (like Bitwarden, LastPass, KeePass) is the most secure and practical solution.
6. Write down tips learned from the evaluation.

Even small increases in length (e.g., from 8 to 12 characters) can yield exponential gains in security.
Adding just one symbol or number to a simple word makes a difference, but truly random characters are best.
A string of four common, unrelated words (passphrase) can be significantly stronger and easier to remember than a complex, shorter password.
Common substitutions like $ for S or @ for a are easily cracked if they're used in common dictionary words. True randomness is superior.
The internet's speed means "seconds" or "days" to crack a password are completely unacceptable for security; we need thousands or millions of years.
7. Research common password attacks (brute force, dictionary).

Brute-Force Attack:

How it works: An attacker tries every possible combination of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) until they find the correct password.
Impact of Complexity: This is where password complexity (length and character variety) directly affects security. Each additional character and each additional character type (e.g., adding symbols) dramatically increases the number of possible combinations, making it exponentially harder and more time-consuming for a brute-force attack to succeed.
Defense: Long, complex, and random passwords are the primary defense. Account lockout policies (after N failed attempts) also help.
Dictionary Attack:

How it works: Instead of trying random combinations, an attacker uses a list of common words, phrases, names, dates, and previously leaked passwords (dictionaries). They might also try variations like adding numbers (password123) or simple substitutions (P@ssword).
Impact of Complexity: This type of attack is effective against passwords that use common words or easily guessable patterns. Passwords that are long but made of dictionary words are vulnerable if they're not a sufficiently complex passphrase.
Defense: Avoid using dictionary words, personal information, or common patterns. Use random characters or long, unrelated passphrases.
Other Common Attacks (Briefly):

Credential Stuffing: Using stolen username/password pairs from one data breach to try and log into accounts on different websites (because people reuse passwords).
Phishing: Tricking users into revealing their credentials on fake login pages.
Keyloggers: Malware that records keystrokes, including passwords.
Rainbow Tables: Pre-computed tables of password hashes used to quickly reverse common passwords.
8. Summarize how password complexity affects security.

Password complexity directly affects the time and computational resources required for an attacker to guess or crack a password.

High complexity (longer length, diverse character sets, randomness) exponentially increases the number of possible combinations. This makes brute-force attacks computationally infeasible, pushing the time needed to crack a password into millions or billions of years, which is effectively impossible with current technology.
Low complexity (short, dictionary words, simple patterns) drastically reduces the number of possible combinations. Such passwords can be cracked in seconds or minutes using dictionary attacks or simple brute-force methods, leaving accounts highly vulnerable.
